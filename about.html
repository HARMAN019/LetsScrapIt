                    Let's scrap it is a Authorized car scrap dealers website which makes searching, viewing, selection and scheduling of a car scrapping easier. Since Delhi Government has banned the use of cars older thar are older than 15 years in DELHI under the order
                    of Nationsl Green Tribunal. <br> Car scrapping is an option in front of a car owner who is not keen on transferring the vehicle to another state. To curb pollution and battle the slowdown in the automobile sector,
                    the Government of India has proposed and funded a car scrapping policy. This policy aims at replacing old vehicles from Indian roads. Once a vehicle's registration certificate expires beyond its operational limit, a user can go to
                    any government-authorized scrapping Centre and surrender the vehicle. <br> The objective is simply to phase out and recycle old vehicles through a systematic process. The ultimate goal is to reduce environmental pollution caused by
                    old vehicles that have surpassed their lifecycle and run without a valid fitness certificate.
